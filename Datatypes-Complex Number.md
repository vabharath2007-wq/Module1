# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
write the python program to read and print the complex number

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `x` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `x`.

## 💻 Program

a=int(input())

b=int(input())

x=complex(a,b)

print(x)

## Output

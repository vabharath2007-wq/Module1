# Conditional Statements - finding the strong number

## 🎯 Aim
Write a Python  program to read a value and check whether a number is equal to 145 (strong number) using if-else

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. get a user input and assign it as a
2. if a==145
   print("Number is a strong number")
3. else:
   print("Number is NOT a strong number")

## 🧾 Program

a=int(input())

if a==145:
   print("Number is a strong number")

else:
   print("Number is NOT a strong number")

## Output

<img width="976" height="175" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2cef13d-a2ad-4a82-8b07-be530b32f1b0" />


## Result
Thus , the program has been executed succesfully.
